    #
    # Now we create an instance of vtkConeSource and set some of its
    # properties. The instance of vtkConeSource "cone" is part of a
    # visualization pipeline (it is a source process object) it produces data
    # (output type is vtkPolyData) which other filters may process.

    # In this example we terminate the pipeline with a mapper process object.
    # (Intermediate filters such as vtkShrinkPolyData could be inserted in
    # between the source and the mapper.)  We create an instance of
    # vtkPolyDataMapper to map the polygonal data into graphics primitives. We
